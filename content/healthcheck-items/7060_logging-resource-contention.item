        impact_risk_text: "Logging can consume significant resources from the node it is running on and the underlying storage. It should be scheduled seperately from crtical OCP components such as etcd, api server and controllers. Depending on the level of load it may also need to be scheduled on dedicated nodes."
        remediation_text: "Move the Elasticsearch components to infrastructure nodes that can handle the logging loads."
