      question: "Is the persistent volume backed by SSD / NVMe devices?"

        impact_risk_text: "Elasticsearch requires persistent storage. The faster the storage, the faster the Elasticsearch performance. SSD/NVMe level performance is required to handle the high IOPS logging needs. Certain types of storage such as NFS or local raw block volumes can result in unreliability and corruption to data."
