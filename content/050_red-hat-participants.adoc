Purpose
-------
This section should contain a minimal list of Red Hat associates who directly
participated. A good rule of thumb is to restrict the list to associates who
applied billable hours to the project in conjunction with this engagement.  A
typical list should include the delivery consultant(s), the project manager,
and the architect (if present and/or billing).  Also include the TSM if the TSM
was actively involved (i.e. attending status calls, escalations etc...)
